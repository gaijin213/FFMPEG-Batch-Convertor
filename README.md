## ✨ What does this script do?

**FFMPEG Batch Convertor** is your go-to command-line utility for converting videos into multiple formats — fast, easy, and in batches!  
No more repetitive manual conversions. No more puzzling over FFMPEG commands. Just specify your source videos, the format you want, and let it AUTO-MAGICALLY process them for you! 🚀

**🖥️ This script is designed for Linux systems.**  
The script should detect your system and install FFMPEG for you. If for some reason it fails, make sure you have [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and accessible from your terminal.
