## What does this script do?

FFMPEG-Batch-Convertor is a powerful yet straightforward command-line utility designed to automate the video conversion process for users who need to convert multiple video files in one go. Instead of running manual commands for each individual file, this script allows you to process entire folders or sets of files, saving you time and effort.

### Key Features

- **Batch Processing:** Easily convert entire directories of video files in a single command, eliminating repetitive manual work.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Supports conversion to several popular video formats, including AVI, MP4, MKV, and WebM.
- **User-Friendly CLI:** The script is designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, with clear prompts and instructions so you can get your conversions done quickly.
- **Automation over Manual Execution:** Handles all FFMPEG command generation internally, so there’s no need to craft conversion commands or deal with complex syntax.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Can be used on any system where FFMPEG is installed (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
- **Customizable:** Options to choose output formats, configure conversion parameters, and organize results to suit your workflow.

### Typical Workflow

1. **Preparation:** Make sure you have FFMPEG installed and place all your source video files in a designated folder.
2. **Running the Script:** Launch the script from the terminal, specify the desired output format, and provide path(s) to the source files.
3. **Conversion:** The script will automatically process each file, convert it to your requested format, and store the results in the target location.
4. **Results:** Once completed, you will have a batch of converted videos ready for use or distribution.

### Who is it for?

This tool is especially useful for:
- Content creators who need to maintain consistent formats for publishing
- Archivists managing large video collections
- Anyone seeking a quick way to convert multiple videos without learning FFMPEG’s syntax

*The script does not contain any video files and works independently by leveraging the FFMPEG tool. No previous experience with FFMPEG is required—just follow the simple prompts and let the tool handle the heavy lifting!*
